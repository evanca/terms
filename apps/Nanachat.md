## Sharing Personal and Sensitive User Data

We share health and other data exclusively with the Gemini LLM model for the purpose of incorporating this information into prompts. The Gemini LLM model processes these prompts in accordance with their [Privacy Policy](https://support.google.com/gemini/answer/13594961?hl=en#). The shared data is not personalized beyond including a "name" provided by the user, which can be a real name or a nickname such as "Alice," "Grandpa," or "Pumpkin," based on the user's preference.

We also use Firebase Analytics and Firebase Crashlytics to improve our services. This may include analyzing your prompts, including those containing health data, to enhance service performance and user experience.

Additionally, we share your uploaded or taken photos with the Gemini LLM model to facilitate conversations with our fictional character based on these images.
