# Shedely Privacy Policy

**Effective Date:** November 10, 2024  

Happy Code Studio values your privacy and is committed to ensuring transparency in how Shedely collects and uses your data. This Privacy Policy outlines our data practices, including the types of data collected, how it’s used, and how we safeguard your information.

## 1. Data Collected
- **Location (Optional):** We access precise location data, with your permission, to ensure accurate emergency contact support and to connect you with nearby authorities through the "Local Help" feature.
- **Emergency Contact (Optional):** You may choose to save an emergency contact, which is stored locally in your browser (no server storage) for quick access when needed.
- **Usage Data:** We use Crashlytics for reporting app crashes and gather minimal analytics on app navigation patterns to improve performance and user experience.

## 2. Data Usage and Storage
- **Session-Based Storage:** Location data is used only within your current session and is not stored afterward.
- **No Permanent Storage:** Your responses are transferred to Google’s Gemini AI for real-time processing, but they are not stored on any server or database. Shedely does not maintain any permanent storage or databases for user data.

## 3. Privacy and Control
- **User-Controlled Permissions:** You choose whether to share your location and emergency contact information. Both options are entirely optional.
- **Automatic Data Deletion:** Since we do not store any data permanently, there is no need for deletion requests.

Happy Code Studio is dedicated to respecting your privacy and providing you with tools that prioritize your safety and data security.
